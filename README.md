The site is aimed at helping customers to easily access information regarding the restaurant opening/closing times, menu, and location, as well as providing a simple interface for making, viewing, updating, and deleting bookings made with the restaurant. 

## Strategy

### Agile Planning
This project was developed using agile methodologies designed to deliver small features in incremental sprints. Three sprints in total were created each lasting two weeks.

All projects were assigned to epics, prioritized under the labels, Must have, should have, could have. They were assigned to sprints and story pointed according to complexity. "Must have" stories were completed first, "should haves" and then finally "could haves". It was done this way to ensure that all core requirements were completed first to give the project a complete feel, with the nice to have features being added should there be capacity.

A Kanban board was created using GitHub Projects and can be located here and can be viewed to see more information on the project cards. All stories except the documentation tasks have a full set of acceptance criteria in order to define the functionality that marks that story as complete.
