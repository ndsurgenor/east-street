## Manual Testing

The following sections list a number of manual tests undertaken to ensure the site operates according to details listed under [Scope](README.md#scope) and [Structure](README.md#structure) in the README file. Specific dev goals/user stories can viewed (where appropriate) by hovering over the numbers listed under 'Ref(s)' in the tables below; clicking these links will open the relevant section in the README file.

### Navigation

These tests ensure that a user can successfully navigate the site using the provided navbar links, buttons, and footer icons. The booking area of the site requires a username and password to access (username _testname_ and password _test#123_ have specifically been registered for this purpose); specifics around this access are tested below under [Authentication](#authentication). Note that navigation specific to user-made bookings - i.e. page access using 'Update' and 'Delete' buttons - is covered under [CRUD Functionality](#crud-functionality).

### Responsiveness

These tests check that the site responds correctly at various sizes of screen, resizing, hiding, and reformatting elements where necessary. The booking area of the site requires a username and password to access (username _testname_ and password _test#123_ have specifically been registered for this purpose); specifics around this access are tested below under [Authentication](#authentication).

### Authentication

These tests check the sign up, sign in, and sign out functionality of the site which are essential for secure access to the booking area. The username _testname_ and password _test#123_ have specifically been registered to help determine the outcome of these tests.

### CRUD Functionality

These tests determine if a user is able to successfully create, view, update and/or delete a booking, or not as the case may be, through the front-end capabilities of the site. In all test cases, **one must first sign in** to the booking area of the site before completing any of the other steps listed (the username _testname_ and password _test#123_ have specifically been registered for this purpose), while the descriptor 'valid details' indicates that the following is expected:

- 'Date' is not left blank
- 'Date' is not set earlier than tomorrow's date
- 'Date' is not set to Monday/Tuesday
- 'Time' is not left blank

## Automated Testing

A number of automated tests have been written to provide additional validation alongside those manual tests which check for a user's ability to view the booking section, depending on whether or not they are authenticated, as well as attempts to update/delete bookings which do not belong to a user.

All of these tests are found within the [tests.py](booking_sys/tests.py) file in the repository.

## Validator Testing

### W3C
All pages have been passed through the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) successfully save for a few minor issues which have been left 'as is' as attempts to correct them proved unsuccessful and lead to results which devalued the user experience. Specifically, these were:

- The use of a 'background' attribute in the body tag of base.html. The validator suggested to replace this with CSS but attempts to do so meant the background image failed to load
- The use of iframe styling attributes on the location.html page. Again, the validator suggested CSS replacements but these caused the map to display incorrectly and almost be unreadable

### PEP8
All Python files in the booking_sys and eaststreet apps, as well env.py and manage.py, have been passed through the [Code Institute PEP8 Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/). The only warnings given were for the settings.py file which contains a small number of long lines (i.e. greater than 80 characters) under AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS; as this is code implemented by Django itself at setup, these lines will be left unchanged. 

### JSHint
The small JavaScript snippet under the footer of base.html has been passed through [JShint](https://jshint.com/) without issue.

## Accessibility & Performance

### WAVE
The site has been tested using the [WAVE Evaluation Tool](https://wave.webaim.org/report#/https://east-street-bc0671035c95.herokuapp.com/) to ensure best practices have been followed regarding aria labels, heading hierarchy, and contrast between page elements. An initial valuation revealed that the 'Sign Up'/'Sign In' forms had a minor contrast issue with links so this has been corrected for better readability.

### Lighthouse
[Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/) was used to used to produce reports on performance and accessibility for both desktop and mobile versions of the site. The image below shows results for the Home page on desktop and mobile respectively while sitewide results are provided in the table. In all cases the SEO score was 100 which was achieved after adding meta 'keyword' and 'description' tags to the base.html head section.
